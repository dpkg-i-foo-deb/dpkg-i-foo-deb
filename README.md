Years ago I discovered there was a kind of software that won't tie me to a creepy license... Not designed to send tons and tons of telemetry without even myself actually consenting it. By that time I decided to change my entire workflow as well as lifestyle around software. However, I want not only to use FOSS software but also to contribute to its amazing community.

I currently have very basic programming skills in C, Java and Kotlin... I like following instructions the most but I also want to create my own stuff, that's why I want to learn and develop some silly apps in Android.
