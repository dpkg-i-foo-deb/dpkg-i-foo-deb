- 👋 Hi, I’m @dpkg-i-foo-deb
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new stuff about Android, specifically building it by myself, as well as Java and C development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Java Programming language, as well as some basic stuff in C, I like to learn how the Linux Kernel works...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Android Open Source Project as soon as I learn how to be useful there..
